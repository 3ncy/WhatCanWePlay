# WhatCanWePlay
This is an app that helps you and your friends see what games you all have installed and can play rogether.

## Usage
1. After you extract and run the downloaded executable file, press the "Upload your games!" button to upload the games you have installed to the server. There it will be stored together with your id, no other personal info is stored.
2. Then you can send your friends the ID written bellow.
3. After you receive your friend's ID, place it in the input field. In case you want to check multiple people at once, separate the IDs with a single comma (`,`).
4. Then you can press the "Check!" button and you will see the list of games you and all your friends have installed.

If there are any problems with the server, please contact me either here in the issues or on Discord (`Ency#9317`)
